- **Detailed Info:** View device names, connection ports, IP addresses, and MAC addresses.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple setup with Python and Flask.

## 🛠 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aljaz2008/network-visualizer.git
   cd network-visualizer
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare your Excel file:**
   #### In your excel file you have sheets(representing your devices) and the parameters in the sheets
   ##### Example of a sheet(LOOK IN EXAMPLES_XLSX folder)(also in screenshots)
   | Port | connected | Type | IP |
   |------|-----------|------|----|
   |port on device|name of device connecting to|type of this device|ip of this device|
   
   
   | Type    | Meaning |
   | -------- | ------- |
   | S  | Switch    |
   | SR | Server   |
   | R    | Router   |
